Do you manage multiple Git users on a single machine? Do you often switch between work projects and side projects and configure different repositories to use different accounts?

If so, [you might benefit from `guser`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/guser), a small CLI tool that helps make Git user-switching a tiny bit easier by remembering user/email combinations you've used in the past.

As an added bonus, if you try out `guser` you'll also be in a position to give me feedback on my very first CLI tool-- and also the first project I've published to NPM üòé.

## Configuring Git users
You probably recall configuring Git when first setting up your development environment: you likely set up an SSH key to allow Git to authenticate with Github or another remote, and you probably also configured Git with a username and email used to sign your commits.

This second step you likely performed with the `git config` tool that comes with Git, and it probably looked something like this:

```bash
$ git config --global user.name "Margaret Hamilton"
$ git config --global user.email margaret@hamilton.com
```

These commands created and/or edited a configuration file, `.gitconfig`, in your home directory:

```bash
$ cat .gitconfig
[user]
	name = "Margaret Hamilton"
	email = "margaret@hamilton.com"
```

This config file in your user directory is one of three such possible files Git might reference when authoring a commit to determine the username and email to use:

1. `/etc/gitconfig/`, which configures Git for every user on the system
2. `~/.gitconfig`, the aforementioned file, specific to the user who the containing directory belongs to
3. `[repository path]/.git/config`, which sets a configuration specific to a particular repository.

When you set up Git using `git config --global`, you told the `config` tool to create or write to the second, user-level file. But you might have passed `--system` to write to the first system-wide file or `--local` to write to a config file in a repo, provided your current working directory is inside such a repo.

Importantly, values from a local config file (if present) override those from a user config file (if present), both of which in turn override values from a system-level config (if present). Note that we say "values", here: if a local file lacks a value for `user` but has a value for `email`, the local email will be used but the user will be pulled from either the user- or system-level config files, assuming one of these has a user present.


## Managing multiple users with `guser`
We often find ourselves with a default user and email set in `~/.gitconfig` which we wish to override at the level of an individual repository.

Perhaps we have a work email and username set in our user directory, but also wish to work on a personal project and author commits that match the username of a personal Github account. Or perhaps we need to manage multiple work-related Git accounts with different usernames-- for example, one for a Github enterprise instance and another authorized to access a private organization on `github.com`.

Ordinarily, this is as straightforward as running `git config` with `--local` flags for the user and email when inside the repository that needs to override user- or system-level configs. But this can get tedious when we have many accounts to manage or when we frequently clone new repositories (as `.git/config` is not committed or pushed to the remote).

This is where `guser` can help. It's a thin wrapper over these `git config` commands coupled with a means to persist frequently-used config/email pairs to a config file in your user directory, all behind an interactive CLI that lets you quickly choose the config to set:

```bash
$ guser
Checking for local git config...
No local user set
No local email set

    List configs in guser
    Add user config to guser
```

## Alternatives to `guser`

Despite being a CLI tool, `guser` doesn't really follow the [unix philosophy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix_philosophy#:~:text=The%20Unix%20philosophy%20is%20documented,%2C%20as%20yet%20unknown%2C%20program.). While it does one thing and just one thing well, it opts for an interactive interface over pipeability and composability.

If you would prefer a similar tool that can be driven entirely via flags and arguments, check out [WindomZ's `gituser.js`](https://github.com/WindomZ/gituser.js).
