      After teaching myself Python on the job to automate media processing
      tasks, I shifted into software development. Since 2018, I've led a
      frontend team at a Fortune 50, worked on web performance and A/B testing
      at a global e-commerce giant, and helped an ed-tech video startup
      transform its technology stack to scale for a new period of growth.
    </p>

    <p>
      As a collaborative over-communicator who loves to act as a force
      multiplier, I firmly believe that software is a team sport. I'm a
      generalist most experienced with Typescript, React, Node (Express &
      Next.js), and GraphQL, but will learn the right tool for the job. I have
      some specialization in front-end architecture, web video and audio APIs,
      and web performance.
    </p>

    <p>
      I'm interested in teams that push the limits of the possible in browsers.
      I'm especially interested in working with video, in products which involve
      multiplayer real-time collaboration, and in learning to work with WASM.
      I'm ready to go deeper into these areas on a mature team with a growth and
      continuous-learning mindset.
